# Case assignment Data Engineering interview spring 2025:

[This](https://www.energidataservice.dk/dataset/PowerSystemRightNow#metadata-info) API provides a snapshot of power flow and production in the Danish power system every minute. We want an application that reads data from this API in real time, and that generates average values for the last 5 minutes every minute. Assume that the result is to be used as input in a ML model. You are free to decide which data fields are to be processed, and how the results are to be presented/distributed. Use whichever library you prefer, if you want to use a library.

The important thing for us is to see how you solve it, as well as how you think about code craftsmanship (readability, stability, scalability), not that you provide a comprehensive solution. We will use your code as a background for a general discussion about coding and problem solving. We don't expect you to spend more than 2-4 hours on the assignment. For the things you don't have time to do, you can think about how you would solve this, so that we can discuss it at the interview.

We also want you to send us the code ahead of the interview, so that we can have a quick look before we meet. Attachments by email, a link to your Github repo or other online solution work fine as long as we get to see the code on our own machine. If you share by email, please zip your file/files so that we can open the file from our machines (.py files can't be opened from email attachments on our machines). We should have the code available at 8 am on the day of the interview, so that we can have a look at it before the interview begins.

We would like to look at your code during the interview, and it is best if you can bring your laptop and share your screen and show us what you are doing from your own machine. We have both HDMI and USB-C outputs in the meeting room.

Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions!
